Algorithmic Systems Prep

Structured DSA preparation for product engineering roles.

This repository documents my daily algorithmic problem-solving practice 
with a focus on:

- Pattern recognition
- Clean implementation
- Time & space optimization
- Interview-level clarity

---
Objective

To build strong algorithmic intuition while simultaneously 
focusing on Deep Learning, GenAI, NLP, and ML system design.

This is not random grinding.
This is structured pattern mastery.
